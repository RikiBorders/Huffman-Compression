# Huffman-Compression
C++ based program that can be used to compress files. This program utilizes binary trees and queues in order to optimize compression speed. 
In some cases, programs/files can be compressed twice in order to achieve even smaller file sizes. This program can also decompress files
and restore original source code after compression. I wrote this project as a part of my Data Structures course at Hamilton College.


Usage:
to encode files, type "./encode [filename]". To decode files, type in "./decode [filename]". Encoded/decoded files are saved in the same directory 
as the original source files.
